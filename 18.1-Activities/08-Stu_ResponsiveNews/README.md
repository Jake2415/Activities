# Responsive News

In this activity, you are going to recreate the U.S. News and World Report website. This will involve using Bootstrap's responsive grid classes as well as their reordering classes.

## Instruction

- Use the starter file, `usnews.html`, to recreate the layout images given in`lg-xl-layout.png`, `md-layout.png`, and `xs-sm-layout.png` using HTML and Bootstrap grid classes.

- Text content has been provided for you in `copyContent.md`.

- Images have been provided to you in the `ImageContent` folder.

- Use external CSS as needed.

## Hint

- Don't worry too much about content (images and text) at the beginning. Focus on getting the layout working.

- Add content and made needed adjustments after the responsive layout is working.

- You do not yet have all the skills needed to get the page to look exactly like the given images at every screen size, but you should try to get it as close as possible.
